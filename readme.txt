Stop the shortcode madness with Crazy Pills. This plugin helps you to build buttons, notification boxes, check & bullet lists, and highlight the text without using shortcodes. It generates clean and pure HTML. Best of all, you can see what it'll look like as you're editing your text.

RTL layout is supported. Also compatible with frontend editor tools that support TinyMCE, like Themify Builder.
